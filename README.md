# transitive-annotation-pipeline
Create transitive (ISS) annotations for non-core species (bonobo, chinchilla, dog, pig and squirrel) based on human gene annotations.

Note 1: human annotations to CHEBI, HP and MP ontologies are *NOT* processed by the pipeline.

Note 2: for dog and pig, transitive GO annotations are *not* created; for dog and pig, GO annotations are loaded from EBI source via nonrat-GO-annotation-pipeline.
